Fundamental/high priority changes:
- Create access points for aux array management, and pass aux to interface routines.
  - Can use b4step2; aux shouldn't be used for solution-dependent stuff, anyway
  - Will leave out "work" arrays until working with modules
- Make sure BC-parsing logic is reasonably intelligent
  - Like, sanity-checking the periodic case?
- 2d interpolation for corner ghost cells
  - Not such a big deal, I don't think

Cleanup:
- Move get_true_solution... and interface_derivatives to a utilities directory, or something like that.
- setprob_implicit is a bad name
- Genericize names of the "CG" parameters

Would be nice:
- Update setenv.csh like setenv.bash
- Expose initial guess for newton's method?
- Control number of threads with an environment variable
