Fundamental/high priority changes:
- Create access points for aux array management, and pass aux to interface routines.
- Make sure BC-parsing logic is reasonably intelligent
- 2d interpolation for corner ghost cells

Cleanup:
- Loop on iteration number for Newton's method?
- Move get_true_solution... to experimental.
- setprob_implicit is a bad name
- Genericize names of the "CG" parameters
- Kill old 1d derivative routines

Would be nice:
- Update setenv.csh like setenv.bash
- Expose initial guess for newton's method?
- Control number of threads with an environment variable
